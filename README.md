# Balanced Binary Search Tree Project
This project is my first experience with binary search trees. Although this project took 3 more days to finish than the linked lists project, I believe this was a more enjoyable and productive experience. There was no major frustration or deadtime in me trying to wrap my head around node interaction. Intuitively, binary search trees are more complicated than linked lists; BSTs have both left and right nodes as opposed to a singular next node. However, I found that getting a foundation during the linked lists project was the most difficult step. Everything after was easy in comparison.
